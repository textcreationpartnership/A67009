         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT may be hoped, That this plain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will meet no other Enemies than ſuch as are likewiſe Enemies to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> and are loſt to the Senſe of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> ſince the only <hi>Deſign</hi> of it is evidently to promote the true Intereſt of <hi>Religion;</hi> and it does not oppoſe any one Man's honeſt Advantage, or encounter any common Opinion, that I know of, among us: The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation having been long ſince made, That how many Diſputes ſoever there have been rais'd among the too various Denominations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58166:14"/> of Chriſtians, concerning <hi>the Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in Matters of Religion,</hi> with reſpect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> it hath never been a Diſpute, Whether <hi>the Magiſtrate hath Power to Puniſh Immoralities:</hi> The <hi>Proſecution</hi> of Men for their <hi>Vices</hi> hath never been reckoned <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</hi> It being as plainly the Duty of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> from the Word of GOD, which <note place="margin">Rom. 13 4.</note> obliges him to <hi>Execute Wrath upon thoſe that do Evil,</hi> as it is evident, from the diſmal Effects of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> in all Ages, that Laws againſt <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery</hi> are neceſſary for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Communities,</hi> as that <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> are requiſite to their Well-being; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> are as fatal to <hi>Publick Societies,</hi> as they are deſtructive to <hi>Private Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though LAWS are neceſſary to the very Being of <hi>Communities,</hi> and <hi>Good Laws</hi> to their Happineſs; yet they cannot be ſuppoſed, by any Rational Man, to be any more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of themſelves, to procure the Welfare of the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> without <hi>Execution,</hi> than the beſt <hi>Medicines</hi> can procure the <hi>Health</hi> of the <hi>Natural Body,</hi> without the Uſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them.</p>
            <p>If therefore the <hi>Execution of Good Laws</hi> be neceſſary, as is proved, to the Welfare of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities;</hi> and thoſe that concern <hi>Matters of Religion,</hi> as do thoſe for the Puniſhment of <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> are allow'd, in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58166:14"/> Chriſtian Country, to deſerve the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; the Intereſt of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Welfare of the <hi>Community</hi> being ſo deeply concerned therein, it cannot be a matter of Diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it becomes Men that call themſelves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> to promote the <hi>Execution</hi> of ſuch <hi>Laws:</hi> Nay, it cannot be well imagined, how Men can have a <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Service of the Great GOD of Heaven and Earth, or can have a <hi>due Love</hi> to Mankind, who have no regard to the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Welfare</hi> of their <hi>Country;</hi> as ſhall hereafter more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Now, what becomes all Men, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Capacities, to do, in the Promoting of the <hi>Execution</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> my Buſineſs, in the firſt place, is to ſhew is Practicable, and that it may be done by us of this Nation; <note n="*" place="margin">Admone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur omnis aetas id fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>It is very well known, that in the late times <hi>Prophane Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing, Drunkenneſs, Open-Lewdneſs,</hi> and <hi>Prophanation</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> were generally diſcouraged, and ſuppreſſed. And it is as well known, to our Shame, that thoſe Sins have not only ſince revived among us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Impunity of Offenders, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58166:15"/> and Preſerment they have met with, and the Contagion of great and ill Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but have been committed with great Impudence, and without Controul; without either Shame, or the Fear of the Laws; ſo that they were ſeen and heard at <hi>Noon-Day,</hi> and in our <hi>Open Streets;</hi> and as if we were reſolved to out-do the Impieties of the very <hi>Heathens, Prophaneneſs,</hi> and even <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> was too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Wit and Entertainment of our <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Play-Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Sincere Religion</hi> became the Jeſt and Scorn of our <hi>Courts</hi> in the late Reigns.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Debauchery</hi> diffuſed it ſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Body of the Nation, till, at laſt, our <hi>Morals</hi> were ſo corrupted, that <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> had with too many changed their Names; it was reckoned <hi>Breeding</hi> to <hi>Swear, Gallantry to be Lewd, good Humour</hi> to be <hi>Drunk,</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> to deſpiſe <hi>Sacred things;</hi> and it was enough to have rendred one ſuſpected of <hi>Phanaticiſm,</hi> or an abjectneſs of Spirit, and a matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, not to ſuffer ones ſelf to be carried away with this <hi>Torrent of Wickedneſs,</hi> and not to glory in thoſe <hi>faſhionable Vices.</hi> Nay, it was thought an unpardonable Rudeneſs, even for a <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to reprove or puniſh one that was Guilty of them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Solemn Obligations of their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> to do it. And even after the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of His preſent Majeſty to the Crown, tho' <hi>Popery</hi> immediately vaniſhed, <hi>Immorality</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58166:15"/> and <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> ſtill kept their ground, as if they expected an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> with our <hi>Liberties,</hi> after ſo long and <hi>Peaceable a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reformation</hi> was indeed talkt of by ſome Perſons as an Excellent thing, and as a proper way of Expreſſing our Thankfulneſs to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his Mercies to this Nation, and to procure a Continuance of them to us, and to our Poſterity: But <hi>Vice</hi> was lookt upon as too formidable an Enemy to be provok'd, and <hi>Publick Reformation</hi> was thought ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult an Undertaking, that thoſe that gave it very good Words, judged it not ſafe to ſet about it in the time of War, whilſt there were ſo many in Arms on the other ſide; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeemed to decline the Thoughts of it till we ſhould ſee the End of the uncertain War we were ingag'd in; tho' they were, I conceive, otherwiſe inſtructed by <hi>God</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command to the <hi>Jews.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58166:16"/> Policy, too much, and perhaps their own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations too little, were very forward to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure theſe Attempts as the Effect of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and an unſeaſonable Zeal: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a furious Oppoſition from Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, the ill Offices of thoſe from whom better things might have been expected, and the unkind Neutrality of Friends, theſe <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who in a little time began to add ſome others to their Number, not only kept their Ground, but made farther Advances; for our late Excellent QUEEN, of Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, having this Affair laid before Her, in the Abſence of the King, by a Prelate of great Learning and Fame, (the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>) She had juſt Sentiments of it, and therefore thought it became Her to give it Countenance; She Graciouſly condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Thank thoſe who were concerned in it, and readily promiſed them Her Aſſiſtance; and afterwards, upon this Application made to Her Majeſty, She was pleaſed to ſend Her <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Juſtices of Middleſex,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to <hi>put the Laws againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and Vice in Execution with all Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Impartiality; and to this end, that they ſhould be careful and diligent in encouraging all Perſons to do their part in giving Informations againſt Offenders, as they were obliged by their Oath, as Magiſtrates, to do;</hi> and when there was further Occaſion, She ſhew'd She was in earneſt to promote this Deſign, by taking
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58166:17"/> other more effectual Methods for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But as it may well be ſuppoſed, That the Queen's patronizing of theſe Endeavours could not but give Credit and Strength to them; ſo the Affair, by Her Death (it may as eaſily be imagined) muſt loſe a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: But yet the Loſs (tho' it appeared exceedingly great) did not diſcourage thoſe that were ingaged in this Enterprize. For as they firſt ſet about it with little or no Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Patroneſs, becauſe they thought it would be an acceptable Service to the King of Kings, and that it would promote the true Intereſts of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Welfare of their <hi>Country:</hi> So the ſame Conſiderations obliged them to purſue their Deſign with equal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Zeal, tho' they were deprived of ſo great a Friend and Protector. And Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence had by this time ſeemed to favour their Endeavours, by the great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Succeſs that had attended them; for Multitudes of Offenders had been by their means brought to Puniſhment. The <hi>Publick Oppoſition</hi> that was at firſt made to their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking</hi> was broke through, (which the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who hath been a great Encourager of this Undertaking, gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of it, which, it may be wiſhed, there may never be any further Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remember) and the Honeſty of it had recommended it to the Virtuous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced part of the Nation, whom the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58166:17"/> of theſe Matters had reached; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after a ſevere Examination, having not been able to diſcover, that any <hi>illegal Methods</hi> had been uſed, or that any <hi>ſecular Intereſt</hi> was purſued by thoſe, who beſtow'd their <hi>Time</hi> and their <hi>Pains</hi> in carrying on ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and hazardous a Work, as that of <hi>Reformation</hi> will be always found, ſince it is the Oppoſing of ill Men, in their ſinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, which are often more deſirable to them than their very Lives. With theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements they proſecuted their Buſineſs, increaſing their Number by the Addition of Perſons of conſiderable Note, and of the beſt Character; ſome of whom, tho' they were of different Opinions from thoſe of the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Church,</hi> as to ſome Points concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Religion,</hi> were willing to unite their Strength in the common Cauſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and engage in ſo Noble a Deſign, that had done ſo much Good: By whoſe <hi>joint Endeavours,</hi> great Advances have been made towards a <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> which is every Day getting ground, Perſons of <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ranks,</hi> of <hi>conſiderable Fortunes,</hi> and of the <hi>cleareſt Character,</hi> offering Aſſiſtance to it, not only in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> but from ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But ſince it hath been long deſired, that a more diſtinct and clear <hi>View</hi> may be given to the World of this <hi>

               <hi>Advances</hi> of it, which thoſe that have been principally concerned in it (ſo induſtriouſly conſulting Privacy) have not hitherto been prevailed on, by any Temptations, either of Vanity or Reſentment, to make publick; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more deſirous that it ſhould be known by the <hi>good Effects</hi> it produces, than by any <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> or <hi>Narrative;</hi> I ask leave to preſent the World with a <hi>ſhort Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and ſome <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Managers</hi> of it, that the well-diſpoſed part of the Nation that have hitherto been Strangers to it may, by the Knowledge thereof, be induced to join in ſo good a Work, and now eſpecially, ſince this Conjuncture is ſo favourable to it, beyond our Expectation.</p>
            <p>There is a very large Body of Perſons, compos'd of the <hi>Original Society</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with the Additions that have been ſince made of Perſons of Eminency in the <hi>Law, Members of Parliament, Juſtices of Peace,</hi> and conſiderable <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> of known Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and great Integrity, who frequently meet to conſult of the <hi>beſt Methods</hi> for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Buſineſs of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to be ready to adviſe and aſſiſt others that are already ingaged, or any that are willing to join in the ſame Deſign.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Society</hi> is at a conſiderable Yearly Charge for the effectual managing their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but takes no Contributions of any but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58166:18"/> their own Members, by whoſe Endeavours, as was ſaid before, Thouſands of Offenders, in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have been brought to Puniſhment for <hi>Swearing, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Prophanation</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day;</hi> and a great part of the Kingdom has been awakened, in ſome meaſure, to a ſence of their Duty in this reſpect, and thereby a very hopeful Progreſs is made towards a <hi>General Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Second Society</hi> is of about <hi>Fifty</hi> Perſons, <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> and others, who have more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed themſelves to the Suppreſſion of <hi>Lewdneſs,</hi> by bringing the Offenders to legal Puniſhment: Theſe may have actually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and rooted out about <hi>Five Hundred Diſorderly Houſes,</hi> and cauſed to be puniſhed ſome <hi>Thouſands</hi> of <hi>Lewd Perſons,</hi> beſides <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Prophaners</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> as may appear by their <hi>Printed Liſts</hi> of Offenders. Theſe Perſons, by their prudent and legal Management of their Buſineſs, have received great Countenance and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi> and very particular Encouragement and Aſſiſtance, for ſeveral Years paſt, from the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> who are ſenſible of the great Service that is done by them, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon proper Occaſions.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third Society,</hi> is of <hi>Conſtables,</hi> (of which ſort of Officers Care is taken to form Yearly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58166:19"/> a new Body in this City) who meet to conſider of the moſt Effectual way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their <hi>Oaths,</hi> to acquaint one another with the <hi>Difficulties</hi> they meet with, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on proper <hi>Remedies,</hi> to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſeveral Parts of the City, ſo as to take in the whole to the beſt Advantage, for the inſpecting of <hi>Diſorderly Houſes,</hi> taking up of <hi>Drunkards, Lewd Perſons, Prophaners</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> out of the Streets and Markets, and carrying them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> and I muſt obſerve, that this is found a very ſucceſsful Method for <hi>Conſtables</hi> to take, for the Suppreſſing of the abominable Sin of <hi>Swearing,</hi> when <hi>Private Perſons</hi> are negligent in giving of <hi>Informations,</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is careleſs of his Duty.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Rank of Men, who have been ſo highly Inſtrumental in this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking,</hi> that they may be reckoned a <hi>Corner-Stone</hi> of it, is of ſuch as have made it ſome part of their Buſineſs to give <hi>Informations</hi> to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> as they have had Opportunity, of ſuch Breaches of the Laws as were before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Many of theſe Perſons have given the World a great and almoſt unheard-of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in this corrupt Age, of <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Courage,</hi> having underwent, at the beginning more eſpecially of theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, many <hi>Abuſes,</hi> and great <hi>Reproaches,</hi> not only from exaſperated and hardned Offenders,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58166:19"/> but often from their luke-warm Friends, Irreligious Relations, and ſometimes from <hi>Vnfaithful Magiſtrates,</hi> by whom they have been Reviled, Brow-beaten, and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from performing ſuch important Service, ſo neceſſary to the Welfare of their <hi>Country.</hi> And herein theſe brave Men have acted with ſo great Prudence, as well as Zeal, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing it might one day be the Policy of the Enemy of all Goodneſs, and the Buſineſs of wicked Men, who are his Inſtruments, and who could not generally be brought to Shame and Puniſhment for their infamous Practices but by their means, to raiſe Prejudices in the Minds of bad and unthinking People againſt them, and to diſparage their Proceedings, by whiſpering of Jealouſies of their being influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in what they did by Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, That the World may be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to make appear, That theſe <hi>Societies</hi> have been ſo much as treated with, by any Perſon whatſoever, to give <hi>Informations</hi> with any Promiſe of a Reward, or that they have ever received the leaſt Advantage by any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions</hi> upon theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> againſt <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> the Money ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being wholly appropriated to the <hi>Poor,</hi> except the third part of the Penalty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Statute</hi> againſt <hi>Prophanation</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> which, in ſome Caſes, the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> hath a bare Power to diſpoſe of; but was never, that we know of, received by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58166:20"/> any one of theſe Perſons; which I thought fit to obſerve, as a laſting Anſwer to any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of this kind, in Juſtice to them who have gone through <hi>Frowns</hi> and <hi>Reproaches</hi> for the ſake of doing ſo much Good; and that all Men may ſee with how great Reaſon it is, both from the Character of the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Diſcharging of this Service to <hi>Religion</hi> and their <hi>Country,</hi> as well as from the Nature and Neceſſity of it, (which I ſhall hereafter enquire into) that the Name of an <hi>Informer</hi> is now become much more <hi>Glorious</hi> among <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good Men,</hi> than it was grown <hi>Contemptible,</hi> by the <hi>ill Practices</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> in our days: And that it does therefore appear truly <hi>Honourable</hi> for Perſons of the <hi>greateſt Quality</hi> to give <hi>Informations</hi> in theſe Caſes, for the Service of the moſt <hi>High God,</hi> as ſome among us, of <hi>greater Ranks</hi> than the World does perhaps think of, have of late done, and which it hath been obſerved, in divers <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> lately Publiſhed, that even <hi>Princes</hi> under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation were not aſhamed to do. <hi>Now when theſe things were</hi>

               <hi>done, the Princes came to me, ſaying, The people of Iſrael, and the Prieſts and the Levites have not ſeparated themſelves from the people of the Lands, doing according to their Abominations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Eight</hi> other <hi>regulated</hi> and <hi>mixt Bodies</hi> of <hi>Houſe-keepers</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> in the ſeveral Quarters of <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58166:20"/> 
               <hi>Southwark,</hi> who <hi>differ</hi> in their <hi>Conſtitution</hi> from thoſe before-mentioned, but generally <hi>agree</hi> in the <hi>Methods</hi> of inſpecting the Behaviour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi> and other <hi>Officers,</hi> and going along with them, and aſſiſting them in their Searching of <hi>Diſorderly Houſes,</hi> in taking up of <hi>Offenders,</hi> and carrying them before the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and alſo in giving <hi>Imformations</hi> themſelves, as there is Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe before-mentioned, there are about <hi>Nine and Thirty Religious Societies</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which are propagated into other Parts of the Nation; as <hi>Nottingham, Glouceſter, &amp;c.</hi> and even into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they have been for ſome Months ſince ſpreading in divers <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> of that Kingdom; as <hi>Kilkenny, Drogheda, Mannouth, &amp;c.</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Dublin,</hi> where there are about <hi>Ten</hi> of theſe <hi>Societies,</hi> which are promoted by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Clergy</hi> there. Theſe <hi>Perſons</hi> meet often to <hi>Pray, Sing Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> together, and to <hi>Reprove, Exhort,</hi> and <hi>Edifie</hi> one another by their <hi>Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</hi> They moreover carry on at their Meetings, Deſigns of <hi>Charity,</hi> of different kinds; ſuch as Relieving the <hi>Wants</hi> of <hi>Poor Houſe-keepers,</hi> maintaining their <hi>Children</hi> at <hi>School,</hi> ſetting of <hi>Priſoners</hi> at <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of <hi>Lectures</hi> and <hi>daily Prayers</hi> in our <hi>Churches.</hi> Theſe are the SOCIETIES which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58166:21"/> our late <hi>Gracious Queen,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Biſhop</hi> that hath writ her LIFE tells us, took ſo great <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in, that She inquired <hi>often</hi> and <hi>much</hi> about them, and was <hi>glad</hi> they went on and prevailed; which, thanks be to GOD, they <hi>continue</hi> to do; as the Reverend Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> who hath obliged the World with a very particular Account of the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> of them, hath lately acquainted us. And theſe likewiſe are SOCIETIES that have proved ſo exeeedingly <hi>Serviceable</hi> in the Work of REFORMATION, that they may be reckoned a chief <hi>Support</hi> to it, as our late <hi>Great Primate</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi> declar'd, upon ſeveral Occaſions, after he had examined their <hi>Orders,</hi> and inquired into their <hi>Lives, That he thought they were to the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>I might now give an <hi>Account</hi> of a <hi>Society of Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of this <hi>Work,</hi> and another <hi>Agreement</hi> of <hi>Juſtices of the Peace:</hi> But I am withheld at preſent by ſome Conſiderations from deſcending to any further <hi>Particulars</hi> concerning them; and muſt content my ſelf with ſaying what will be eaſily allow'd, That the <hi>ſtated Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of ſuch Perſons are as <hi>proper,</hi> and may be more <hi>uſeful</hi> for the <hi>Promoting</hi> of this <hi>Work,</hi> than any other I have deſcrib'd. For what might we not expect from the <hi>Zealous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> of theſe <hi>Orders</hi> of Men in this Affair?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58166:21"/> which, 'tis obvious, will not be employ'd with ſo great Effect, as when they <hi>form</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>Societies,</hi> or, at leaſt, have <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>ſtated Times</hi> of Meeting, for the <hi>Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this Buſineſs.

            <p>We have ſeen ſome <hi>few Perſons</hi> ingaging in this <hi>Enterprize,</hi> before they had any <hi>Methods</hi> to direct them, or many <hi>Examples</hi> to incourage them, encountring <hi>Oppoſition</hi> in the firſt <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Deſign, from <hi>open Enemies,</hi> and perhaps <hi>falſe Friends,</hi> ſuffering cruel <hi>Mockings,</hi> unkind <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and unjuſt <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and yet not <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way.</hi> We have ſeen them ſurmounting their <hi>greateſt Difficulties,</hi> ſo that the main brunt ſeems now near over, and going on with that <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Succeſs,</hi> that the <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>publick Wickedneſs</hi> is viſibly abated. We are told, that many <hi>Thouſands</hi> have been brought to Puniſhment for <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58166:24"/> their means; <hi>Seventy</hi> or <hi>Eighty Warrants</hi> a Week having been executed on theſe Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in and about this City only, ſince the late <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> againſt <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing</hi> was made, which hath given ſo great and remarkable a Check to thoſe <hi>Scandalous Sins,</hi> that our <hi>Conſtables</hi> ſometimes of late have found it difficult to take up a <hi>Swearer</hi> in divers of our <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Markets,</hi> where, within a few years paſt, <hi>horrid Oaths, Curſes,</hi> and <hi>Imprecations,</hi> were heard Day and Night; that a multitude of <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Prophaners</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Day,</hi> ſome of whom kept, as it were, <hi>open Markets</hi> within a few Years paſt, have been made <hi>Examples</hi> by their means; that <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Diſorderly Houſes,</hi> which were little better than Stews, and Neſts for <hi>Thieves, Clippers</hi> and <hi>Coiners,</hi> &amp;c. have been rooted out and ſuppreſſed; and that ſome <hi>Thouſands</hi> of <hi>Lewd Perſons</hi> have been <hi>Impriſoned, Fined,</hi> and <hi>Whipt;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Tower-End</hi> of the Town, and many of our <hi>Streets,</hi> have been much purg'd of that <hi>peſtilent Generation</hi> of <hi>Night-Walkers,</hi> that uſed to <hi>infeſt</hi> them, which were a <hi>Reproach</hi> to this <hi>Noble City,</hi> and a <hi>Scandal</hi> to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Forty</hi> or <hi>Fifty</hi> of them having been ſent in a Week to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> where they have of late received ſuch <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Number of them hath choſe rather to be Tranſported to our <hi>Plantations,</hi> to work there for an honeſt Subſiſtence, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

But thus much may be ſaid, That the <hi>Endeavours</hi> of thoſe <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> have not been conſined to this <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but have extended as far as <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they have had an Influence, very little, I think, to the Honour of that Kingdom from whence it had its <hi>firſt Riſe,</hi> of which, ſince a more particular Account may be expected, I may ſatisfy my ſelf, at preſent, with ſaying in general, of my own Knowledge, That the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> here having been near <hi>Two Years</hi> ſince laid before ſome few Perſons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and moſt of thoſe (I muſt again obſerve) <hi>private Perſons,</hi> and of the <hi>lower Rank</hi> of Men, with proper Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to move 'em to unite in the ſame <hi>Deſign,</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> to purſue it with Advantage, it determined them to engage heartily in it; and they have proſecuted it with ſo much Vigour, that there are now <hi>ſeveral Societies</hi> for <hi>Reformation</hi> in the City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> which I am aſſured, by divers Accounts that I have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58166:25"/> in my Hands from thence, are ſpreading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by his Excellency the Earl of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> one of the <hi>Lords Juſtices</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Right Reverend the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> many of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the beſt of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of that City: In <hi>One</hi> of which <hi>Societies,</hi> moſt of the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>pious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> particularly the celebrated <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and divers other <hi>Perſons of Quality,</hi> are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; ſome of whom have ſhewn a <hi>Zeal,</hi> which if it prevailed the <hi>Three Kingdoms</hi> over, might ſoon produce a Glorious Reverſe of the State they are now in, and which in leſs than <hi>Two Years</hi> ſpace hath ſucceeded, tho' not without ſuch various Oppoſitions, as might be expected, from Combinations of bad Men, to that degree in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that the <hi>Prophanation</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> by <hi>Tipling</hi> in <hi>publick Houſes,</hi> by Exerciſing of <hi>Trade,</hi> and Expoſing of <hi>Goods</hi> to Sale, is almoſt ſuppreſt; that <hi>Lewd Women</hi> are ſo ſtrictly enquired after, and ſeverely puniſhed, that they have Tranſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in <hi>England,</hi> to our <hi>Plantations;</hi> and that <hi>Swearing</hi> is ſo run down, that an <hi>Oath</hi> is rarely heard in their <hi>Streets;</hi> ſo that <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſorders</hi> are remarkably cured; and, in ſhort, <hi>Vice</hi> is afraid and aſhamed to ſhew its head, where within a few Years paſt it was daring and Triumphant.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:58166:25"/>
            <p>We are likewiſe aſſured, That <hi>Scotland</hi> hath concurred in theſe <hi>Matters,</hi> where His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's <hi>Proclamation</hi> againſt <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> hath been iſſued out in very ſtrict terms, and His late Gracious <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of that Kingdom, takes notice of the Progreſs that they have made in the <hi>Forming</hi> of <hi>Methods</hi> for the Diſcouraging of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and aſſures them, <hi>That 'tis a WORK moſt acceptable to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>own Nation.</hi> We are made acquainted, That many <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men, of different <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,</hi> are ingaged in this Work, to which Men of <hi>Virtue,</hi> of <hi>Temper,</hi> and <hi>unblemiſhed Reputation,</hi> may either <hi>join</hi> themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Quality, Circumſtances,</hi> or <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,</hi> or may <hi>form</hi> themſelves into <hi>new Bodies:</hi> That the <hi>publick Oppoſition</hi> that was made to it, which our Poſterity may bluſh to read of, is at an end, which, 'tis to be hoped, will be the laſt that we ſhall hear of in a <hi>Chriſtian State,</hi> and under a <hi>Proteſtant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> That the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> eſpouſes it, where there are <hi>Two Sermons</hi> Quarterly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and divers of them Printed, to make Men ſenſible of their <hi>Obligations</hi> in this reſpect. And it's true alſo, That <hi>Swearing</hi> is much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, as we have reaſon to believe, by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58166:26"/> 
               <hi>Accounts</hi> we receive in moſt, if not in all Parts of the Kingdom, as other <hi>publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> are in many; and that <hi>Societies</hi> for <hi>Reformation</hi> have been in divers Places already actually form'd, and are going on in many others; as particularly in <hi>Glouceſter, Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Coventry, Shrewsbury, Hull, Nottingham, Tamworth, Newcaſtle, Leverpool, Cheſter,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Corporations;</hi> ſo that in a few Months time, by the <hi>Methods</hi> that are now taking, there is reaſon to believe that we ſhall hear of a very <hi>conſiderable Progreſs</hi> in this Work from all Parts of the Nation. And now is this a Time for Men, that would be reckoned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to ſtand <hi>Neuters,</hi> in an Affair wherein their <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Country,</hi> and their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> are ſo deeply concerned? Let the Men who can contentedly ſee the <hi>Laws</hi> of GOD trampled upon; who can, in their ordinary Converſation, in the Streets, and even at their own Tables, hear horrid <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Curſes,</hi> nay, Men calling upon GOD for Damnation upon themſelves and others; in a word; offering high <hi>Indignities</hi> to the Glorious <hi>Majeſty</hi> of their Great <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> conſider whether the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> who would not ſuffer their <hi>Artificial Deities</hi> to be affronted, or their <hi>Religion</hi> to be deſpis'd; who in Sieges, and other Diſtreſſes from their Enemies, were more concerned for their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Altars than for their own Houſes, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58166:26"/> private Affairs, do not condemn them? Let our Learned Rabbies, the great Diſputers of the World, and all that make a Profeſſion of Religion, but give little better account of it than by expreſſing a fierce and uncharitable Heat againſt thoſe that differ from them in ſome things relating to Religion, but not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to it, and wherein all Men equally wiſe and good have, I doubt, never yet been fully agreed, think ſeriouſly with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether they might not employ ſome ſhare at leaſt of their Parts and Zeal to much better purpoſe, in furthering the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of Mens Lives, and of the <hi>Manners</hi> of the Nation, by the Suppreſſing of <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> than by raiſing or keeping up, with an unchriſtian Temper, to the manifeſt Injury of the Chriſtian Religion, which is an Inſtitution of Love, dangerous or unneceſſary <hi>Controverſies</hi> or <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and making of Proſelytes to their New Opinions or Party; all Religions being, I think, agreed, that <hi>bad Men</hi> are a Scandal to the beſt Religion, and that they cannot, if they continue ſo, be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in any; and conſequently, that the being inſtrumental in the bringing over of a few Souls to the ſincere Practice of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by any Chriſtian Methods, which thoſe I am treating of will, I hope, be allowed to be, is of greater Service to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the World, than the gaining of Hundreds that are vicious to any particular
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58166:27"/> Church or Party. But can Men of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſatisfy themſelves with complaining of the Iniquities of the Age, and wiſhing for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> with giving only ſome <hi>good Words</hi> to theſe <hi>Proceedings,</hi> or even praying for <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon them, without doing, as they have Opportunity, what is neceſſary to <hi>promote</hi> them, when, as it hath been ſaid, we have the <hi>Laws</hi> of GOD, of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and, as we have reaſon to hope, the <hi>Government</hi> on <hi>our</hi> ſide; and moreover, ſo many <hi>Examples,</hi> and ſo great <hi>Succeſs,</hi> to incourage us, and have now, generally ſpeaking, not much more to fear than Calumnies and hard Words, and moſt of thoſe, 'tis to be hoped, from the Enemies of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which the beſt of <hi>Men,</hi> and the beſt <hi>Deſigns</hi> in all Ages, have ever met with, and which, in ſuch a Caſe, it is our <hi>true Glory</hi> to ſuffer? No, ſurely this is a <hi>Time,</hi> as I ſhall endeavour to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for all <hi>good Men</hi> to join their <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> their <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> in this ſo <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> ſo <hi>Great,</hi> and ſo <hi>Glorious</hi> a <hi>Work.</hi>

            <p>Having now laid before the <hi>Reader</hi> a ſhort Scheme of this <hi>

'tis their Duty to be diligent in the furthering it, wilfully neglect to excite all ſorts of People, eſpecially thoſe belonging to their Charge, of what Rank or Quality ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to do their Duty likewiſe in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in their reſpective Stations, the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,</hi> they can give a good Account of their Conduct to thoſe of their particular Charge, who have no concern to diſcharge their Duty herein, only for want of their being admoniſhed of it, and are not Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, in ſome degree, in the <hi>Common Guilt</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> which, as our Neglect of our Duty in this particular Inſtance, of not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a <hi>Reformation,</hi> will encreaſe, ſo it may be a means notwithſtanding our preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from Deſtruction, to <hi>draw down</hi> God's Judgments upon the Kingdom, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to make no better uſe of the Peace we have with our Neighbours, than to fight with our crying Enormities againſt our God; which as I think few Nations, if any, have had in theſe laſt Ages greater Reaſon to dread, ſo, I ſuppoſe, all will grant, that none ſeem to have greater reaſon to uſe all proper means to prevent, than thoſe who expect to give Account, not only for their own Sins, but <hi>for the Sins of ſo many others beſides, if they wilfully ſuffer them to periſh in them by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to uſe the neceſſary means of preventing their living and dying in them.</hi>

I needed not to have been thus long upon this Head of Example, and particularly the malignant Influence of the bad Examples of Magiſtrates and great Men, if moſt Ages did not abound with ſuch unhappy Inſtances; and if this Nation in particular had not felt ſo much the fatal Effects of them, as may be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58166:34"/> ſome Excuſe for my inſiſting on it. But to go on: Beſides the Miſchief that is done by the vicious Examples of Magiſtrates, With what Reaſon can we expect, that thoſe that make no Conſcience to <hi>break the Laws,</hi> ſhould diligently and conſcientiouſly <hi>Execute the Laws</hi> upon others? And ſuppoſing ſuch Magiſtrates ſhould ſometimes, either out of a fear of the Inſpection of the <hi>Government</hi> into their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, in the Reign of a Prince that is zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Diſcouraging of Vice; or out of a deſire of keeping up their Reputation with better Men, be ſometimes inclined to puniſh ſuch Offences in others, as they are themſelves guilty of, conſciouſneſs of their own Faults will, when they act upon no better and firmer Principles, deprive them of Courage, and be very apt, upon many Occaſions, to draw them back from the Puniſhing of others; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Offenders are either their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors or Equals; whereas the Law knows no reſpect of Perſons, and they whoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is to Execute it, muſt do it without Diſtinction or Partiality. Their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> tells them, that they are <hi>to chaſtiſe and puniſh all Perſons in the ſaid County offending.</hi> And can any that conſider this, That we live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Chriſtian Government, and that the Apoſtle acquaints us, That the Magiſtrate <hi>is the Miniſter of God for Good;</hi> That <hi>he beareth</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58166:38"/> conſidering the Original Corruption of our Nature, which is generally more depraved by our Education in a degenerate Age; that being thus depraved and weakned, we find it no very eaſie work to reſiſt Temptations to Sins, to which we have either habituated our ſelves, or have a natural propenſity, when they are naked and alone; and that 'tis much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to encounter thoſe Sins when Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to them are made ſtronger by the bad and eminent Examples which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every-where to be ſeen in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the World, there being but few that we meet with that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend one Vice or other by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to our Imitation, and (which is, I think, ſtill worſe) moſt of thoſe not ſuch as profeſs themſelves Enemies of Religion, but that pretend themſelves Chriſtians, entertain hopes of receiving the Benefits of Religion, and attend its Ordinances with Allowance, as often as they think it for their Intereſt or Reputation to do ſo; conſidering, I ſay, theſe things, have we not great reaſon to fear, that moſt Men will continue to go over to the major Party, that triumph in Wickedneſs, and that few will have the Courage and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to join with the leſſer and too much deſpiſed Party of Virtue, to go againſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58166:38"/> the Stream of a Debauched Age, (which, for ought I can ſee, there is greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that it ſhould ſtill grow more ſtrong and furious, than that it ſhould abate) till frequent and publick Examples of Vice are taken out of publick View by either the Execution of our Civil Laws, or by the Revival of the ancient Diſcipline of the Church. <hi>Seneca</hi> could, it ſeems, obſerve, That it was enough to ſhake the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Socrates,</hi> or a <hi>Cato,</hi> to bear up againſt and ſtem Vice, when it becomes ſo general and faſhionable, that it preſſes upon us with a kind of publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And tho' Chriſtians have a clearer Revelation than thoſe Heathens had of their Duty, higher Obligations, nobler Motives, and greater Aſſiſtances to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, yet, I conceive, our Religion does not teach us, nor our own Experience of Humane Frailty does not encourage us to make the way to our Duty and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as difficult as we can. 'Tis true, as may be objected, that Men are by no means to be ſuppoſed Religious, who are reſtrained from their Vices only by ſenſe of Shame, or fear of Humane Puniſhment; but yet they muſt be thought to be in a much fairer way of being ſo under thoſe Reſtraints, than they would be without them. By their being kept, by Humane
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58166:39"/> Laws, from an Indulgence of their vicious Inclinations, they may in time find the Pleaſure and the Advantage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: And bad Examples, that abound in moſt places, which I take to be the great Occaſion of Sin, being by this means taken away, <hi>Vice</hi> will become Scandalous, and <hi>Virtue</hi> will be in proportion eſteemed faſhionable; and thus, I think, very great Points are gained. For when Men that are vicious in their Inclinations, and even thoſe that are grown old in Senſuality, ſee that <hi>Religion</hi> gives Men that Eſteem and Advantage as <hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> hath done within our Memory; and they find that the Stream is turned, and bears hard againſt them, that they cannot commit their Diſorders with Impunity, nor without Shame; and moreover, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them are very much taken out of the way, then they will take ſome pains to be Virtuous, at leaſt to appear in the Dreſs of Virtue; then may we expect that ſuch Men will begin to enquire into the Nature and Reaſons of Religion, and when they find, by a ſober Advertence to its Propoſals, (which they will now make without Prejudice,) and by ſome Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they will have of the happy Effects of it, by their endeavouring to imitate it, that it prohibits us thoſe things that would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58166:39"/> be moſt highly injurious to us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Satisfaction to our rational Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; that it hath ſuch Excellencies as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and put out of countenance all the Advantages that the World can offer; that it fortifies us againſt the croſs Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences and Calamities, the Changes and Storms of Life, and the Fears of Death, diſarms it of its Stings and Terrours: to ſay no more, that it ſilences the bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances and ſtinging Reproaches of Conſcience, delivers us from Plagues and Fears, Confuſion and Sorrow, from the tormenting Guilt, and the cruel Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Outrages of our Luſts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gives us in Exchange the noble Pleaſure of the Victory over our ſelves, who are our worſt Maſters, the Joys of Innocence, the Triumphs of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Extaſies of Heavenly Hopes, and directs us to the Regions of Bliſs, to <hi>Joys unſpeakable and everlaſting:</hi> Then may it be that the good Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we may call the Seeds of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which ſeemed before as it were choak'd in ſome with ill Habits, may be awakened, and revive; and that others, who had ſome weak Inclinations to Religion, but had not ſtrength enough to bear the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that now too often, if not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attends the ſincere Practice of it, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58166:40"/> go in an untrodden way, againſt the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Cuſtom and Example, will take courage: Then may we hope to ſee Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that hath been ſo long ſlighted and oppreſſed, drawn out of its Obſcurity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that Contempt which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and Inſolence of Sin hath flung upon it, and imbittered it, be admired, embraced, and enthroned. So that the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> taking away out of publick View <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,</hi> by a ſtrict <hi>Execution of the Laws,</hi> ſeems as proper, if not as neceſſary a means for the keeping of Vice from the further ſpreading its Contagion, and the retrieving of Virtue, as the preventing of thoſe that have the Plague upon them from mixing with thoſe that are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and ſhutting of them up is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſtopping the Raging of that Diſtemper; and as it is not to be doubted, that where thoſe that have the Plague vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly upon them, are allowed to converſe promiſcuouſly with the Sound, even to walk publickly in the Streets, it muſt be a certain ſign that the Diſtemper is Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical, that there is little hopes of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to it; or that thoſe whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs it is to ſhut up, and take care of the Diſeaſed, are themſelves infected with the Diſtemper; ſo it muſt in like

May not ſuch <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> be juſtly charged with being a great Cruſe of the Debauchery of the Nation? And what a load of Guilt muſt thereby lie upon them? Unhappy Men, that when they have ſo many Sins of their own, they will by this means contract ſo terrible an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> who have been flea'd, and whoſe Skins have ſerv'd to cover the Bench or Place where they ſate: But what is this Puniſhment to that which an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful Magiſtrate</hi> hath reaſon to fear in the next World, tho' he meets with none in this? Suppoſing then from His Majeſty's <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and the <hi>Addreſs</hi> of the late Houſe of Commons, that there may have been, within our Memory, ſome ſuch Magiſtrates as theſe, does it not behove ſuch Men ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to lay to heart the dreadful Sin of their having been Promoters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Kingdom, and of publick Ruine? And I need not ſurely tell them, that 'tis not enough for them to be ſenſible of their Guilt and Danger, to be ſorry for the great Miſchief they have done their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without heartily endeavouring, as they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58166:46"/> have opportunity, to retrieve it by their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Diligence and contrary Behaviour. The Nature of diſtributive Juſtice, which their Office acquaints them with, requires a Man to repair the Injuries he has done to any. This is ſo ſtated a Rule among Divines, in the various kinds of known and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Injuries we may do to the Souls and Bodies, Eſtates and Reputation of our Neighbours; and is ſo generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that I ſhall not labour to prove it. If then 'tis allow'd, that all ſorts of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Injuries that we do our Neighbours, without Repentance for them, expoſe us to the Juſtice of God; and that our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not in ordinary Caſes reckoned ſound and compleat, unleſs we endeavour, when it is in our power, to repair the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries we have done; Can ſuch Men be imagined ſo blindly partial to themſelves, as not to think, when they have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſhonoured God, have drawn, by their wicked Examples, Numbers of Men into Sin, or confirmed 'em in it, have made uſe of their Authority to patronize Vice, (and perhaps to diſcredit and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe juſt Endeavours of Reformation) in Contempt of their Oaths and Truſts; and have thereby done ſo much Injury to a Kingdom, that they are not obliged, for the removing the load of Guilt that is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58166:46"/> upon them, the obtaining Forgiveneſs from <hi>God,</hi> a well-grounded Peace in their own Minds, and Eſteem from Men, ſincerely to endeavour to repair the Injuries they have done <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> or their <hi>Country,</hi> by their future Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence? And till they do give the World ſome proof of this, they will not take it amiſs if we do not think, that their late Repreſentatives in Parliament have put them under too heavy a Charge; and if we ſay that this is ſo very Great, that tho' we are ſure that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the beſt Religion in the World, yet it ſo much condemns ſuch Practices, that ſuch as are guilty of them are a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to their Profeſſion, that we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon honeſt <hi>Heathens</hi> are not the worſt ſort of Men; or rather, that there are few, if any, worſe than corrupt and unfaithful Magiſtrates. And therefore, methinks, tho' ſuch Magiſtrates were deaf to all Counſel, were ſo given over to a Spirit of Slumber, that no Motives that have been offered them from Religion will make any ſuch Impreſſion upon them, as to awaken them to a ſenſe of their Sin and Danger, if they have yet any thing of the Modeſty of Men remaining, Shame might oblige them to a better Behaviour; that they ſhould not be able to look a Man in the Face
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58166:47"/> that hath a Love to God and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but more eſpecially, that they ſhould be in the greateſt Confuſion to hear in our Churches, if they ſhould come there, the King's <hi>Proclamation</hi> Four times in the Year, charging them with being the great Cauſe of the Increaſe of <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> in the Nation. It hath been generally thought an Indication of a good and generous Mind to deſire an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Reputation among Men; and, on the contrary, a ſign of a baſe Soul wholly to deſpiſe it; on which Conſideration <hi>Solon</hi> might well preſume in the Laws he gave the <hi>Athenians, That he that hath no Value for his Reputation, will have little or no Regard to the publick Intereſt:</hi> For how can it be reaſonably imagined, that he ſhould have a tender ſenſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Intereſt of his Country, who hath no ſenſe of his own Honour and greateſt Intereſt, but that he will ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them upon Occaſion? Indeed, he that hath neither regard to Conſcience, nor ſenſe of Shame, ſeems not only in great danger of not being reduced to Virtue by any common Methods, but to be loſt to almoſt all good Purpoſes, to be unfit for common Intercourſes with Men, but much more unfit to be honoured and entruſted with the Care

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58166:50"/> and other <hi>Inferior Officers</hi> Obligations in this reſpect, which fall in with that of the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s.</p>

The Tenor of the <hi>Church-Warden</hi>'s and <hi>Sideſmen</hi>'s Oath in the Dioceſs of <hi>London,</hi> is as follows:</p>
            <q>You ſhall Swear truly and faithfully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Office of a Church-Warden within your Pariſh, and according to the beſt of your Skill and Knowledge preſent ſuch Things and Perſons as you know to be preſentable by the Laws Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of the Realm.</q>
            <p>And one of the <hi>Articles of Enquiry</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the <hi>Miniſters, Church-Wardens,</hi> and <hi>Sideſmen</hi> of every Pariſh, runs thus: <hi>Are any of your Pariſh known or ſuſpected to be guilty of</hi> Inceſt, Adultery, Fornication, <hi>or any other Enormous Crimes? Do any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the</hi> Lord's-Day, <hi>or any other great Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> GOD? And if the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Sideſmen</hi> neglect to Preſent, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> are told, <hi>That they may, and ought to preſent, as they have the higheſt Obligations to ſuppreſs Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58166:50"/>
            <p>From hence 'tis plain, That the Power of Inferior Officers, as well as that of Magiſtrates, is great, and would have a very remarkable Effect for the Suppreſſing of publick Diſorders if it was generally uſed, and might (with God's Bleſſing) go very far towards a National Reformation, with the Aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrate, if private Perſons would but do as, I conceive, becomes them, in giving Informations againſt <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Drunkards, Lewd Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Day,</hi> to the Magiſtrate, which ſhall be my next Buſineſs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Conſideration of all that have a Love to God, their Neighbour, or their Country.</p>
            <p>It hath been proved, That the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good Laws is requiſite, in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances, for the Suppreſſing of Vice, and the Effecting a Reformation of Manners; but Magiſtrates cannot put the Laws in Execution againſt Offenders without they have the Knowledge of the Offences: And they cannot be preſent at all Places to obſerve them, tho' they have either ſuch a Senſe of their Duty, or ſo pious a Concern to do all the good they can in their Office, as frequently to take their Walks, to obſerve Diſorders, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the worthy Magiſtrates have here done, in the ſeveral Quarters of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58166:51"/> in which they live, and in embracing all Opportunities of uſing their Authority for the Suppreſſing them: And thoſe Offences that are <hi>deeds of Darkneſs,</hi> it may be hoped, for the Honour of our Magiſtrates, are not now generally and knowingly committed before them. One would think that the Preſence of a Magiſtrate ſhould have ſuch an Awe upon ill Men, that they ſhould not dare to tranſgreſs before him: That he ſhould reſent it as a high Affront to him, if a Perſon of the higheſt Rank ſhould diſcover ſo baſe an Opinion of him, as to expect that he ſhould be content to break his Oath, to ſuffer him, upon the Account of his Quality, to go unpuniſhed for any Offence of this kind committed before him. It is certainly much ſo where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have a juſt Senſe of Honour, or are as Zealous and Faithful in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Office as they ought. But the leſs this may reaſonably be hoped from all Magiſtrates at this day; there appears, I am ſure, the more reaſon, or rather neceſſity, for private Perſons apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to this Buſineſs of giving Informations to them of our reigning Sins, without which, it is not reaſonably to be expected that Offenders will be generally brought to Puniſhment, eſpecially in Cities and Corporations, where it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58166:51"/> without Uncharitableneſs, that many are daily either publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately breaking the Laws againſt Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Immorality.</p>
            <p>Thus then our giving of Informations of theſe Offences to the Magiſtrate ſeems abſolutely neceſſary in our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as we heartily deſire or expect the Suppreſſion of Prophaneneſs and Vice by Humane Laws. And I deſire thoſe who would be informed whether there is any Direction or Example for this Practice from the Word of God, to conſider the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Texts of Scripture: <hi>If there be found</hi>

               <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend which is as thine own Soul, entice thee ſecretly, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us go and ſerve other Gods. Thou</hi>

               <hi>ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine Eye pity him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him. But thou ſhalt ſurely kill him;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> 
               <hi>thine Hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to Death, and afterwards the Hand of all the People. And all Iſrael ſhall hear,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and fear, and ſhall do no more any ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58166:52"/> Wickedneſs as this is among you.</hi> Now tho' this Method of giving Informations to the Magiſtrate againſt prophane and vicious Perſons may appear to unthinking People to carry Severity in it, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that it may be lookt on as a comprehenſive Branch of Charity, and a Religious Office, when 'tis performed, as other good Acts ſhould be, with pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, upon proper Occaſions, and in a Chriſtian Temper.</p>
            <p>It is, in the firſt place, a great Kindneſs to the <hi>Poor;</hi> the Money that is raiſed by Convictions upon theſe Statutes againſt Prophaneneſs and Vice being by Law given to them, whereby they have in Fact had, for ſeveral Years paſt, in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a conſiderable Supply, in the times of their great Diſtreſs; and the Burthen of the Proviſion for them, that hath lain ſo heavy on Pariſhes, hath been eaſed: So that this Office, if there was no other Reaſon for it, one would think ſhould be agreeable to Men of Charity, to thoſe eſpecially whoſe Circumſtances will not permit them to give ſuch Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Poor as they could otherwiſe wiſh; the Good of our poor Neighbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby promoted by the ſame Act that prevents God's Diſhonour. But the giving of Informations againſt Offenders will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58166:53"/> be found, upon an impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, to be a real <hi>Act of Charity,</hi> even towards the Perſons offending, and to the Publick, as well as to thoſe who are relieved by the Penalties levied upon them.</p>
            <p>'Tis univerſally acknowledged, that we are not only to apply our ſelves to the working out our own Salvation, but that we are to be concern'd for the Salvation of one anothers Souls, and to endeavour to further it, according to our Advantages and Opportunities; and that this Care is an Expreſſion of great Charity to our Neighbour, and highly acceptable to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58166:53"/> to commit the more Sin, by falling into Paſſion, or other Unchriſtian Irregularities, and he bids defiance to all other means, as he too often does, when he is ſo far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his Wickedneſs, that he values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon it, and makes a <hi>Mock at Sin,</hi> as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

And does not the neglect of doing this, the ſuffering him to go on in his wicked Courſes, to the manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the ruin of his Temporal and Eternal Intereſt, rather than the bringing him to whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Puniſhment, ſeem rather an Argument of fooliſh Pity, than of Love; of a cruel and treacherous Fondneſs, than real Kindneſs? We do not think it an expreſſion of Kindneſs to our deareſt Relations, that are lying under dangerous Diſtempers, to chuſe rather to ſee them quietly die, than to uſe Medicines that will give them more Pain and Diſturbance, but are proper for the Recovering them. And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58166:54"/> it is not the leſs Kindneſs to them becauſe in their deſperate and delirous Fits they have not a Sence of the Good we intend them by it, but refuſe the Remedy, and perhaps fly in the Face of the Phyſician; nay, when Inciſions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, when a Member is to be cut off to prevent a Gangreen, we tie them down, and their Cries and Reproaches of hardſhip and ill uſage, though they are in their Senſes, do not hinder the Operation. And have we not ſo much Compaſſion for thoſe miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who have little or no true Compaſſion for themſelves, that lie under the Lethargy of Sin, whereby their Souls are in ſo great and evident danger of being for ever loſt, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by the Magiſtrates Puniſhment of them, to ſcarifie and awaken them out of their dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sleep, to a Senſe of their dangerous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and the Conſideration of it, which may have its beginning in the Fear of the Law, that they are driven to by the Shame and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is thereby brought upon them, may be a means of working the happieſt Effects, may end in their heartily embracing wholſome Counſels. And will not they then think, that they that brought them to legal Correction did them a Kindneſs, how grievous ſoever it was to them when it was upon them; and that it was happy for them that they met with that Puniſhment that led them to Wiſdom? and when this Method for the good of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Soul fails, we may, as after the uſe of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58166:54"/> other proper means for the Cure of his Body, though without Effect, reaſonably give our ſelves ſome ſatisfaction upon this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone: But, in the next place, this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is however a high Service to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; for <hi>Religion</hi> being every Man's great Intereſt, every one's Work or Duty, <note n="*" place="margin">Religio contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata ad o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnium pertinet Injuriam.</note> the Community, according to the Senſe of the Civil Law, is injured by the Contempt that is flung upon it, by the open Affronts and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of it, which every Man, as in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe, is therefore concerned to prevent. Now the Exemplary Puniſhment of open Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders is the proper way (as Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may convince us) to repreſs publick Vice and Prophaneneſs, to keep the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from it, and to prevent God's Diſhonour: It is, I conceive, one way moreover to keep us from being <hi>Partakers in other Men's Sins,</hi> and to take away National Guilt; for a Nation may then be ſuppoſed to contract publick Guilt when Wickedneſs is publick and inſolent, when the Supreme or Subordinate Magiſtrates and Miniſters do, by their own ill Examples, and by their not Exerciſing their Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, countenance and confirm Men in it, and the Body of the People have no concern for the Suppreſſing of it: But a Nation is not thought to draw upon it that publick Guilt which calls for National Puniſhment by the private Sins of particular Perſons, which could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by either the Magiſtrates, Miniſters,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58166:55"/> or the Peoples Care and Endeavours; much of which ſeem to be intimated to us, as from other Texts of Scripture, ſo particularly from theſe following: <hi>The hands of the Witneſſes ſhall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 7.</note> 
               <hi>be firſt upon him to put him to Death, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the hands of all the People. So thou ſhalt put the Evil away from among you. And all the People ſhall hear and fear, and do</hi>

               <hi>no more preſumptuouſly. Then ſhall his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Mother lay hold on him, and bring him unto the Elders of his City, and unto the Gate of his Place. And they ſhall ſay unto the</hi>

               <hi>Elders of his City, This our Son is ſtubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our Voice; he is a Glutton and a Drunkard. And all the Men of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
               <hi>his City ſhall ſtone him with Stones that he die: So ſhalt thou put Evil away from among you, and all Iſrael ſhall hear and fear.</hi> Where we may obſerve, that for the ſuppreſſing of Sin, and the preventing of publick Guilt, even Parents were commanded to bring their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be puniſhed with Death, if after they were corrected by them for Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were not amended by it.</p>
            <p>If then the Puniſhment of Offenders, by the Execution of the Laws againſt Debauchery and Prophaneneſs, is neceſſary to the Suppreſſing of Vice, and thoſe Laws will not be generally Executed, unleſs Perſons acquaint Magiſtrates with the Breaches of them; if thoſe that do ſo exerciſe Charity to the Souls of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58166:55"/> take a proper courſe thereby to avoid a Participation in their Guilt, to make a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Wants of the Poor, to promote a general Reformation of Manners, to remove National Guilt, and prevent God's Judgments falling upon the Body of a People, can any wiſe and good Men, that duly conſider theſe things, conclude, that they that zealouſly, and upon proper occaſions, give informations to the Magiſtrates of the crying Enormities of this Kingdom, do that which is not agreeable to their Profeſſion, as becomes Chriſtians, or as good Members of the Community? nay, that conſidering our preſent circumſtances, that there is ſo little probability that a general Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Manners will be carried on without it, whether they are not almoſt, if not altogether as neceſſary for this purpoſe as our Statute-Book, I was like to have ſaid, as even our Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? And then, laſtly, can any wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Men think, that ſuch ſerviceable Perſons as theſe, that often expoſe themſelves to Inconveniencies in diſcharging this Office for Conſcience-ſake, which may be perhaps the moſt difficult and invidious, and therefore a highly honourable part in this arduous work of Reformation, do not deſerve great reſpect, and good words at leaſt from thoſe, who, tho' they have juſt thoughts of the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of it, have not Zeal enough them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to diſcharge it? and the good words that are given them, and the reſpect that is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58166:56"/> paid them upon this account, may, in many caſes, be a means of furthering this work, which are ſuch cheap and ſafe things, that, 'tis to be hoped, they will not be thought too much to be afforded by the moſt faint-hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that is willing to contribute any Endeavours towards it; which, it may be expected, thoſe that deſerve the Name of Chriſtians will. For though thoſe brave Men are thus willing to expoſe themſelves, often to reproach and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips from bad Men, for ſuch noble purpoſes, it will, I think, notwithſtanding, conſidering the infirmities of Humane nature, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of this Nation, be our Prudence and Religion to endeavour, by all proper methods, to prevent their being put too much upon the tryal of Sufferings from profligate Men, which, 'tis ſelf-evident, our particular countenance of them, and ſpeaking well of their Actions upon all due occaſions will effectually do. Our Laws ſuppoſe ſuch Men thus highly uſefull, as clear reaſon tells us they are, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Virtue, and indeed for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Government. Her late Majeſty of Glorious Memory, in purſuance of Her great Deſign of <hi>Reforming the Nation,</hi> did therefore in Her Gracious <hi>Letter</hi> to the Juſtices of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex, Command them to give Encouragement to thoſe Perſons that ſhould bring them Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Offences;</hi> and the Juſtices of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> the Magiſtrates of <hi>London,</hi> and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Cities of the Kingdom, from a ſenſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58166:56"/> of the great Service that is done the Publick by ſuch perſons giving Informations, or rather, as may be ſuppoſed, from the abſolute neceſſity of it, do in their Printed Orders invite thoſe that are Well-wiſhers to their Country, to bring them Informations of the Breaches of the Laws againſt <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and tell them 'tis their Duty to do it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to give them Encouragement. And now, laſtly, His Majeſty by His <hi>Proclamation</hi> does command all <hi>Judges, Mayors, Sheriffs, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace, and all other Officers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and all his Subjects, whom it may concern, to be very <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi> and <hi>Strict</hi> in the <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and the <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Proſecution</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhall be guilty of Exceſſive Drinking, Blaſphemy, Prophane Swearing and Curſing, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Prophanation of the Lord's-Day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as they will anſwer it to Almighty God, and upon pain of his higheſt Diſpleaſure.</hi> So that thoſe who oppoſe the giving of <hi>Informations</hi> in theſe Caſes, not only ſeem directly to ſtrike at the Foundation of our Conſtitution, but do oppoſe Reformation, and confront the Government, which are Enormities that demand a due Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all that are concerned for the honour of our Government, our Laws, or our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if any Magiſtrates ſhould diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe that bring them Informations on this occaſion, by giving them hard words, making their work as difficult to them as they can,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58166:57"/> by wilfully forcing them to long and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Attendance on them in this Buſineſs, or not ſheltring them from the inſults of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders, if any ſhould be ſo inſolent and daring as to offer them, 'tis I think, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they not only act therein contrary to their Duty, as Chriſtians, but to their Oaths and Truſt, as Magiſtrates, and to their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Loyalty and Obedience to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Subjects. And now, is it poſſible to conceive that any Magiſtrates can deſire the execution of thoſe Laws; nay, that any that are not the greateſt Enemies to it, and are loſt to all ſenſe of true Honour as well as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould, in defiance of all their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in full Contradiction to their printed Orders with their Names to them, publickly ſet up by their direction on Churches and other publick Places, not treat with reſpect, and give the greateſt Encouragement to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons, particularly by making this buſineſs as eaſie to them as they can, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them from any kind of Affronts and Aſſaults from wicked Men, and giving them all poſſible diſpatch, who in ſuch a profligate Age do, for the preventing the Indignities that are offered to the great God, and the ruin of their Country, bring them, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with trouble, and ſometimes with great difficulty, Informations of ſuch Offences? And, on the other hand, I do not ſee, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, how thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58166:57"/> that the giving of Informations to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of theſe Offences is a Chriſtian Office, a likely and proper, if not a neceſſary means of <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> and yet wholly neglect the doing it at a time when they ſee their Fellow-Chriſtians engaging ſucceſsfully in it, can in ordinary caſes eaſily ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they have a due Zeal for God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Charity to their Neighbours. 'Tis allowed, that this will be ſometimes done with ſome Danger and Inconvenience, <note n="*" place="margin">Dulce eſt pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſequi Deum.</note> but ſo much the more laudable is the doing of it. A brave Man, who refuſes to live under the ſlaviſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Cuſtom and Example, who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works againſt Wind and Tide, and ſteers in the Teeth of Danger, muſt expect to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times toſt and batter'd; but Dangers and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties do often invite, rather than diſcourage ſuch a one from doing that which becomes him. Virtue could, I think, be hardly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a kind of Senſuality, if it were gained without any Labour. Every mean Soul can do ſuch things as require no Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Courage, that are not attended with any trouble or inconvenience; but though there has never been ſo general a corruption in any Age or Nation, as that there have not been ſome conſpicuous for their Piety, yet the number of thoſe wiſe and happy perſons have, in moſt Ages of the World, been too few, who have preferr'd their Duty to all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. If 'tis not generally thought fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58166:58"/> ſhionable to inform, let it be conſider'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis faſhionable to be Religious. Don't Men uſually meet with the reproachfull Names of Hypocrites, Fools, Enthuſiaſts, Phanaticks, or formal and preciſe Perſons, who lead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or but modeſt and regular Lives? But thoſe Men that underſtand what Religion is, do not ſurely think this a ſufficient Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them to be Libertines. They know that <hi>Eliſha</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were called Mad-men; that Holy <hi>David</hi> was derided by the People; that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Ages were treated accordingly. Wiſe Men and Chriſtians are not ſo much afraid of ill Names, as of wicked Actions: And our Judgment of Actions muſt not be taken from the opinions of Men, but from the Nature of them, otherwiſe the Notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> will be ſoon confounded. Thoſe Actions are diſhonourable that carry in their Nature a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to Reaſon and Religion; but if thoſe Actions that directly tend to preſerve and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Government, to promote Religion, and the good of Mankind, be honourable, then the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Informations upon theſe occaſions, that are ſo much countenanced and encouraged by the Government and the Laws, are, I conceive, truly honourable, though corrupt Men judge otherwiſe; <note n="*" place="margin">Apud quos vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus inſania &amp; furor eſſe dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> ſuch, for inſtance, who think it more honourable to reſent an Affront with the loſs of their own or their Fellow-Chriſtians Lives, and reckon, in ſhort, Temperance and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58166:58"/> Chaſtity, Meekneſs and Humility, Zeal for God, and Heavenly-mindedneſs, contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities, and fit for mean and baſe Souls. Let it be remembred, that Chriſtians are <hi>to walk by Faith, and not by Sight;</hi>

So that putting this Caſe at that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage as the cowardly and formal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (who will not fail to raiſe Objections, and ſtart difficulties on ſuch an occaſion) would have it, and will be ſure himſelf to do, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the giving of <hi>Informations</hi> of theſe Offences ſhould ſometimes expoſe Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull Words, or rude Treatment from an <hi>ill Magiſtrate,</hi> or a proſligate Offender, which it will not be for the honour of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to countenance, 'tis the buſineſs, I think, of Chriſtians to conſider, whether they ought not to ſuffer Shame, and undergo ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Loſs for the Exerciſing an Act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their Neighbours Souls, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of <hi>National Sins,</hi> the preventing of <hi>God's Diſhonour,</hi> and the ruin of their <hi>Country,</hi> now eſpecially that their Endeavours of this kind will be ſo very likely to be effectual for theſe ends.

Their holy Lives they are ſenſible do reproach them, which is very grievous to them, and for this Cauſe they often, I ſuppoſe, bear a Hatred to them, which put them upon ſeeking Opportunities, which they ſoon enough find, to injure them, either in their Goods, in their Bodies or in their Reputation, of which there is given us in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> a very lively Deſcription; <hi>Let us lie in wait for the Righteous, becauſe he is</hi>

            <p>If then Wicked Men have ſuch an Enmity to the Righteous, and do by various ways often injure and oppreſs them, it is no wonder that the giving of <hi>Informations</hi> ſhould, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Offices or Duties ſometimes do, make Men liable to Oppoſition and Sufferings from bad Men, who deſire to indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quietly in their Vices, becauſe this is a downright diſturbing and confronting them in their vicious Practices: But 'tis, as hath been ſaid, our Buſineſs to conſider, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life is a Warfare, that Chriſtians are ſent into the World, as Soldiers into the Field, to fight againſt it, the Fleſh, and the Devil; and that as a Captain is tryed in a Battle, an expert Seaman in a Storm, ſo a Chriſtian by the Temptations of all kinds that he meets with in his Warfare, by which we are diſciplined or catechized for a happy Eternity; and that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58166:60"/> therefore he muſt march on through all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Diſcouragements, <note n="*" place="margin">Per infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam &amp; bonam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari ad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> particularly through Honour and Diſhonour, through good and bad Report, to Immortality; and therefore whether the danger of our being expoſed to Reproach and Contempt from wicked Men is a ſufficient Reaſon for our having no regard to this Charitable Office I am recommending? The Heathen Emperour, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus,</hi> could tell us, <hi>That in purſuit of Virtue we muſt expect Reproaches and Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but that we muſt have little or no regard to the common Opinions of Men,</hi> which, after <hi>Socrates,</hi> he reckoned as the common Bugbears of the World, or the Terrour of Children.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58166:62"/> Colour of Excuſe for their Unfaithfulneſs, they being under the Obligations of Oaths and Truſts, ſuper-added to thoſe they have as Chriſtians) from uſing their Diligence in the Execution of the Laws, and particularly from giving all Countenance and juſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to thoſe who bring them Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at the ſame time that Prophaneneſs and Debauchery do appear ſo ſhameleſs and fearleſs among us, what a weight of Guilt may be ſuppoſed to lie upon this Nation? And in how great danger of Miſery and Deſtruction may it be apprehended to be, which I do not ſee with what Reaſon we can expect will ſo likely be pervented by any other Means, as by the cloſe Conjunction, the zealous and united En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of good Men, for the Retrieving of Religion, and the Morals of the Nation, by all Chriſtian and Prudent Methods. For Religion in general, and the Practice of every Moral Virtue in particular, do in their own Nature tend not only to the Felicity of every Man's private Life, but do alſo conduce to the Peace, Order and Welfare of all publick Societies, and good Government over Men, as it hath the greateſt Influence for theſe Ends upon Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Subjects. Religion teaches and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Governours to over-rule their Subjects in the Fear of God, to his Glory, and for the Safety and Proſperity of thoſe that are in Subjection to them; and therefore, I think, to endeavour to ſupport and encourage them in the Exerciſe of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58166:62"/> Religion and Virtue, and this as well by the Uſe of their Authority, (which may, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, be expreſſed by their Perſonally Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing and Promoting Men of Virtue, and Diſcountenancing vicious Men, by their taking Care that good Laws be made for the Security of Religion; and that the Laws that are made for the Promotion of Chriſtian Virtues, and the Suppreſſion of Vice, be put in Execution) as by their own Exemplary Behaviour, <note n="*" place="margin">Non ſi inflectere ſenſus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58166:68"/> to the Laws of God, ſeems to be the neareſt and moſt probable way, in our preſent Circumſtances, for the retrieving of the Virtue of the Nation; without which, if we could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this Kingdom would continue to be proſperous, I do not eaſily conceive how wiſe and good Men ſhould either take much Pleaſure in Living otherwiſe than in Obedience to the Will, and for the Glory of God, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own Salvation, or in the Thoughts of leaving a Poſterity behind them in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where there is no more Religion, or even common Honeſty; I intended, I ſay, having done this, in the next place to offer ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt thoſe Vices that are moſt reigning among us, as <hi>Leudneſs, Prophane Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing, Drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in hopes that the Repreſentation of the Baſeneſs, the Folly and Beaſtiality of thoſe Sins, together with the various and great Miſchiefs they bring upon the Publick, but more eſpecially often upon thoſe unhappy Men that are addicted to them, in reſpect to their Eſtates and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Perſons and Poſterity, their Bodies and Souls, would ſhew ſo much the Evil and Deformity of them, that it might be a means to keep ſome at leaſt from falling in Love with them, and of diſingaging others from them who are already enſnared in them, even as the Sight of a Drunkard to a thinking Man is a good Lecture againſt Drunkenneſs: But theſe Sheets growing to a Bulk, far beyond what I at firſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58166:69"/> propoſed, I ſhall lay aſide (perhaps for ſome other Occaſion) the Materials which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this purpoſe; and I ſhall the rather do ſo, <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 28, 34.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Perſons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and that we find, by ſad Experience, that thoſe who are fully reconciled to their Luſts, who are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abandoned to the Conduct of Cuſtom and ill Example, ſeem too generally almoſt deaf to the Calls of Conſcience, to all Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kind, nay often even to the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rhetorick of the Goſpel; at leaſt they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make, for want of Conſideration, and other proper means, no great and laſting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon them. And this, I conceive, makes the uſe of other Methods with ſuch Men neceſſary, not only for their own ſakes, but for the publick Safety, that thoſe that are Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and almoſt <hi>dead in their Sins,</hi> yet having Senſes ſtill to feel the Stroaks of Juſtice, may, tho' never ſo ſtubborn, be bowed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcipline, and puniſh'd into a better outward Behaviour, if they cannot into ſuch a ſerious Conſideration of their Sin and Folly as may end in an inward and entire Reformation of their Lives, which is by no means to be totally deſpaired of. For as the allowed Habits of theſe Sins exclude Men from the Kingdom of Heaven, in the Opinion of Divines they ought to ſhut out thoſe who are guilty of them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58166:69"/> from the Communion with the Church on Earth, till they give ſome ſigns of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as, 'tis allowed, they would have done if they had lived in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when ſuch Offenders, which now make too great a part of the viſible Church, were looked on as a kind of Monſters, and, like putrefy'd Members, were cut off, as being not only extreamly dangerous, but very noiſome to the Body. But till the Eccleſiaſtical Power, which is now ſo weakned, and hath, to ſpeak juſtly, loſt its Credit, is recovered to its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Deſign, and the ancient Diſcipline of the Church is in ſome meaſure reſtored, which, 'tis to be hoped, we ſhall not always think ſufficient, eſpecially under the preſent Reign, publickly to lament the loſs of once a Year, in the Office for <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> but ſhall in good earneſt endeavour to reſtore. There is, I conceive, evidently greater reaſon to engage the ſecular Arm in this matter, that thoſe upon whom the gentle Methods of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion have little or no force, and whom the Eccleſiaſtical Power does not and will not take any Notice of, ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed, and reſtrained by the Civil Government; that they ſhould be treated as a ſort of Out-Laws, and as common Enemies to their Country: For publick Immoralities are Offences againſt the Peace and Happineſs of Mankind, againſt the Government and the Laws, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtian Religion, which is not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58166:70"/> only now incorporated into the Law of the Land, but does above all other things promote the Safety and Proſperity of Government, and of particular Perſons, which Offences of this kind directly tend to the deſtroying of, even to the diſſolving the band of Humane Society; and if ſo, ſurely it behoves good Men, by all proper meaſures, to aſſiſt Magiſtrates in their Endeavours effectually to ſuppreſs them. If bad Men don't approve of theſe Methods, 'tis no wonder; they are Enemies to good Order, Law, and Juſtice, becauſe theſe things are troubleſome to them. There is no doubt but the <hi>Gallows</hi> is a great Grievance to Murtherers, the Diſcipline of <hi>Bridewell</hi> to Whores, the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory</hi> to the Perjured, and the <hi>Stocks</hi> to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards: But ſuch Grievances as theſe are, I conceive, of near as long ſtanding as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will not be thought proper to be laid aſide whilſt it laſts, or at leaſt till there is not ſo much Occaſion for them, ſince, as hath been proved, <note n="*" place="margin">Facile eſt imperium in bonos.</note> its Intereſt and chief Buſineſs is to cheriſh and ſupport Religion, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to take care that it be not treated with any diſreſpect, particularly, that it be not made the Scorn of any Order or Body of Men, the common Subject of the Prophane Play-Houſes, or the Sport of Buffoons; and that the open Violations of it by <hi>Prophane Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing, Drunkenneſs, Lewdneſs,</hi> &amp;c. be ſuppreſſed, as all wiſe Nations, I conceive, have ever done, and ever will do.</p>

            <p>Againſt theſe Enormities therefore that are the Plagues of Government, the Enemies of our Peace, the Diſhonour of our Religion, and the Reproach of our Nation, have the <hi>Societies of Reformation</hi> applied themſelves, with ſo great Succeſs, as to give ſo very promiſing hopes as have been repreſented, of a general Concurrence and Union of the Virtuous part of the Nation in the ſame Deſign, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a National Reformation; and their Endeavours have been carried on, as hath been obſerved, for above Eight Years with as little or leſs occaſion given to their Enemies of Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to the Methods of their Proceedings, or to the Behaviour of the Perſons concerned in them, as perhaps have been often known in Matters of the greateſt Conſequence, where ſuch a number of Perſons have been engaged, (though if the Prudence of ſome good Men, who are either already engaged, or that ſhall hereafter be concerned in this Undertaking, is or ſhould be leſs than their Zeal, it will, I hope, be far from giving wiſe and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men a juſt Prejudice to the Deſign it ſelf, or keeping them from Aſſiſting in it.) But, bleſſed be God, a more glorious Proſpect hath been lately given us by the <hi>Addreſs</hi> of the late Houſe of Commons to His Majeſty, for the Suppreſſing of <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and His Majeſty's <hi>Proclamation</hi> in purſuance of it, and His Princely Word in His Gracious <hi>Speech</hi> to both Houſes of Parliament.

And now can any that love their God, their Religion, or their Country, hear of theſe tranſporting things without being affected with greater Joy than any Succeſs in their own ſecular Concerns would give them, and without thinking themſelves under high Obligations, after they have pretended to Faſt, and Pray, and Mourn for our publick Sins for ſo many Years paſt, (as moſt, if not all Orders of Men and Parties among us have done) to do what they are able in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stations for the Suppreſſing of <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

But how much ſtronger Obligations do now lie upon us to do it? And how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and inexcuſable will our Neglect of it be, now we have ſuch an Opportunity by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's repeated Declarations for our Engaging in it, by the Advances that are already made, and the Methods that are laid, as perhaps may never again be offered us if we neglect this? in Proſecution whereof it would, I think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us to adventure all our deareſt Intereſts in this World, nay, a Thouſand Lives, if we had them to loſe.

An Act of Charity to prevent any Injury to your Neighbour in his civil Concerns, to hinder a Fool or a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick from wounding of his Body, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his Life? And is not a ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevent the publick Diſhonour of the <hi>Name, the Day,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Magiſtrate with theſe high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, in order to the Suppreſſing of them, as is done with general Approbation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in other ordinary Caſes, when Men's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights, the Security of the Government, or the Welfare of the Nation is concerned, an honourable Work, and becoming Chriſtians?

            <p>Prophaneneſs and Debauchery have, in truth, been ever Infamous in the Opinions of the wiſe and good Men in all Ages of the World, and treated as ſuch by the Religion

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58166:84"/> unſeaſonable, or imprudent, as they do moſt other things of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which, 'tis much to be both feared and lamented, many of them want either Zeal, or perhaps Honeſty to undertake, which Men of no leſs true Wiſdom, (if that Principle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be called Caution or Policy, that keeps Men from doing their Duty, deſerves the Name of Folly, rather than Wiſdom,) not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but ſurmount the appearing Difficulties of.

Nay, the higher the Tide of Debauchery and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs runs, the more evident Reaſon there is for us to look to our Banks, to uſe all proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the Oppoſing of it, and the more generous and brave is the Oppoſition, unleſs 'tis more reaſonable to give way to it, and expect an Inundation of Wickedneſs and Ruine, than to endeavour to prevent it, ſince as the Caſe will grow the worſe, and more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the delay, ſo the Objections that are now made againſt it will thereby grow the ſtronger.</p>

And will you any longer defer your Declaring and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in this Glorious Work, now it ſeems ſo apparent that this Cloud that appeared ſo little to you at firſt is like to overſpread our whole Horizon; that one of the moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uncomfortable Objections which was made to this Undertaking, of its being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, which we have too much reaſon to ſuſpect to be upon other like Occaſions a frequent Excuſe for Fear, Lazineſs, or want of good Principles, is taken off, by the great Succeſs that hath attended it; that the Heat of the Day, the fierceſt Oppoſition to theſe Attempts, ſeems much over; and that you have ſo very great reaſon to conclude that the Virtuous part of the Nation, of all Parties, will fall in and give their Aſſiſtance in it, when more particular <hi>Methods</hi> ſhall be laid before them; that if we point our united Batteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrong holds of Debauchery and Prophaneneſs; if we proſecute this Religious War with Conduct and Reſolution, which is ſo ſucceſsfully begun with ſo unequal a humane force, we have Victory in view, we may, with God's Bleſſing, ſee a Reformation throughly eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and put upon ſuch a firm Foundation, as that it may not be eaſily in the Power of a

But is it not enough that you that have had an early Knowledge of theſe Tranſactions, have not ſooner engaged in a Cauſe which you could not well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, without great Inconſideration or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but ſecretly to approve of under all its Diſadvantages, when it was in it ſelf the ſame as it is now with its Succeſs, and meerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe you thought the Service might be too hot for you, and therefore you left it to others to engage in an Oppoſition to Vice whilſt it was Triumphant, to fall upon it in its Intrenchments, to bear the brunt of the Battle, and reſerved your ſelves for leſs doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous Service, till the main Body of the Nation ſhould come up, and Victory ſhould be turning on the ſide of Virtue? Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice in this Caſe, as in War, may be almoſt as miſchievous and as criminal as Treachery.

And, on the contrary, what ſevere Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they may hereafter make on their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, who, after this Matter is plainly laid before them, and a publick Reformation of Manners ſeems to be put as it were into their hands, will either openly oppoſe, or ſecretly undermine the juſt Endeavours of it, or that will not be prevail'd upon either to concur in the Methods that are already laid, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any other that they can ſuppoſe may be more effectual for the carrying on a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reformation, that can contentedly look on and ſee their Fellow-Chriſtians ſuffer in any kind, by their brave Oppoſition to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Enemies of God, and the Devil's Kingdom,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58166:93"/> the Cauſe of Religion to be injured and depreſſed, and their Country ſo much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, for want of their giving their ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and zealous Aſſiſtance to it, I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>I will only add, That if the Attempts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which were began with ſo great Diſadvantage, have born up under ſo many Difficulties, which are carried on by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Endeavours of ſuch Bodies of Men, in the ſeveral Parts of this City, are ſpreading through the Cities and Corporations of the Kingdom, and are propagating in thoſe of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who have a Communication with one another, are governed by Methods that have been approved by Perſons of great Wiſdom, and conſummated Judgment, and which have been ſo highly ſucceſsfull, ſhould be defeated by the Induſtry and Power, the Number and Intereſt of its Enemies: If, I ſay, we ſhould ſuffer Debauchery and Prophaneneſs to regain their ground, and to carry the Victory, after the Advances that are thus made towards the Suppreſſing of them, and the Encouragements and Advantages we have for the Carrying of them on to ſo glorious an Iſſue, have we not very great reaſon to fear that we may never again have ſuch an Opportunity put into our Hands? Can it be thought ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, humanely ſpeaking, to bring the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Men together that are now engaged
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58166:94"/> in it, to rally and reaſſume a Baffled Cauſe, wherein they may perhaps be apt to think they may have made a full and diſmal experiment of the deſperate Averſion and Oppoſition of this Generation to Reformation, have, if they have acted therein, and in other parts of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſincerely, kept the Guilt of publick Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs from lying on them, and may have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their own Souls? Or is there any probability that this Cauſe will be revived and ſucceſsfully retrieved by thoſe, whom no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will now prevail on, to concur in the preſent Methods, or to give any other zealous Aſſiſtance to it? And, who is there that believes that there is a Righteous God that governs the World, that will not fear, how ſanguine ſoever ſome Men may be upon the firmneſs of our preſent Peace and Settlement, that notwithſtanding our Councils and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, we ſhall feel the Effects of the high Diſpleaſure of Almighty God, upon whoſe Bleſſing the Stability of our preſent Peace and outward Proſperity does depend; that <hi>He will be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> And if <note place="margin">Jer. 6. 9.</note> this ſhould prove to be our diſmal Caſe, might it not then be ſaid over us; O ungratefull and rebellious Nation, that wouldeſt ſo provoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Patience and Forbearance, wouldeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſe ſo many gracious Offers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn ſuch various Methods of Mercy, as if thou had'ſt been deſperately reſolved upon Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction!
